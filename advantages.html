    <div class="advantages">
      <ol>
        <li style="font-size:25px;"> Availability</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Machines don’t require frequent breaks and refreshments as like human beings.</li>
          <li>This can be programmed for long hours to work and can perform the job 
		  continuously without getting bored, distracted or even tired.</li>
          <li>Using machines, we can also expect the same kind of results regardless 
		  of timing, season and so on, the ones we can't expect from humans.</li>
        </ul>
        <li style="font-size:25px;">Day to Day Application</li>
        <ul>
          <li> In our daily needs, a smartphone also becomes the 4th necessity for the human along with dress, food & shelter.</li>
          <li>Designing the automation methods by using learning and perception has become a common phenomenon in our daily lives.</li>
          <li>A smartphone is one of the apt everyday examples of how we make use of AI's power to reduce barriers in everyday life.</li>
          <li>AI is widely deployed and utilized by the financial institutions and banking sectors to organize and manage data.</li>
        </ul>
        <li style="font-size:25px;">Digital Assistance</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Highly advanced organisations, on behalf of humans, have already implemented machines to interact with their customers using 'avatars.'
             <br>It is the digital assistants or replicas that will help reduce human resource requirement.</li>
          <li>Robots can not pinpoint the user's sentimental factor. It has actually programmed for only logical thinking
            and taking the right program decisions based on the machine 's existing experience.</li>
          <li>For AI Machines, emotions can only be identified in a rational way of thinking.</li>
        </ul>
<li style="font-size:25px;">Handling Repetitive Jobs</li>
<ul>
  <li>Repeated jobs, in nature, are tedious. Such jobs can be handled easily with the help of AI algorithms. These kinds of work in
    between do not require much intelligence.</li>
    <li>Machine intelligence can be employed to carry out dangerous tasks which may cause injury to the human involved in that. </li>
    <li>Whenever human operates the machine-like playing a game or run a computer-controlled robot, it means
      that we are actually interacting with AI Machines.</li>
    <li>Machines can think much faster than humans and can perform multi-tasking to obtain the best results</li>
</ul>
<li style="font-size:25px;">Medical Applications</li>
<ul>
  <li>Doctors/Physician assesses the patient’s health-related data and intimates the risk factors to the customers via the
    health care devices with the help of artificial machine intelligence.</li>
    <li>It helps the patient to know about the side effects of different medicines and also behaves as personal digital care.</li>
    <li>Robotics is used often in the treatment for mentally sick patients to come out from their depression also make them remain active in the real world.</li>
    <li>The current medical industry has the popular application of artificial intelligence is Radiosurgery.
      It helps us to operate the tumors without damaging the unaffected surrounding tissues.</li>
</ul>
<li style="font-size:25px;">Hazardous Exploration</li>
<ul>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence and the science of robotics are the fascinating advancements in technological development.
    Using this, we can able to handle the huge volume of data for storing and processing but not limited to as well as we can use
    that in the process of mining and other fuel exploration processes.</li>
    <li>These complex machines can be utilized to overcome human limitations.
      We can utilize these machines as a replacement for the humans wherever we felt the process done by the human is hazardous
       but can’t neglect that because of the goodness or results received.</li>
       <li>They can perform difficult tasks and accurate work with greater responsibility without any lag. Moreover, they do not wear out easily.</li>
</ul>
<li style="font-size:25px;"> Reduction Error</li>
<ul>
  <li>The advantage of using Artificial Intelligence is, it helps us for error reduction and increasing
    the chance of reaching higher accuracy with a greater degree of precision.</li>
    <li>It can be applied in various situations including the process called exploration of space.</li>
</ul>
