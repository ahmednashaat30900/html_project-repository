  <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
  <p>It is one of the applications of AI where machines are not explicitly programmed to perform
     certain tasks rather they learn and improve from experience automatically. Deep Learning
     is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks for predictive analysis.
      There are various machine learning algorithms such as Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning
      , and Reinforcement Learning. In Unsupervised Learning, the algorithm does not use classified
      information to act on it without any guidance. In Supervised Learning, it deduces a function from
       the training data which consists of a set of an input object and the desired output. Reinforcement
       learning is used by machines to take suitable actions to increase the reward to find the best possibility
        which should be taken in to account.</p>

              supervised machine learning algorithms can apply what has
               been learnt in the past to new data. Starting with the
               analysis of a known training dataset, the learning algorithm
               produces an inferred function to make output values predictions.
               After sufficient training the system can provide targets for any
                new input. The learning algorithm can also compare its output to
                 the correct output and find errors to alter the model accordingly</td>
            <td style="background-color:#7FB3D5 ;">Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when training information
              is neither classified nor labeled. Unsupervised learning studies how systems
              can infer a function from unlabeled data to describe a hidden structure.
              The system doesn't figure out the correct output, but explores the data
              and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled information.</td>
            <td style="background-color:#76D7C4 ">Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms fall somewhere between supervised and
              unsupervised learning, as they use both labeled and unlabeled data for training-typically a
               small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The systems which use this
                method can significantly improve the accuracy of the learning. Similarly, semi-supervised
                 learning is chosen when the labeled data acquired requires competent and relevant resources
                  to train / learn from it. Otherwise, unlabeled data acquisition generally requires no additional resources.</td>
            <td style="background-color:#82E0AA ;">Reinforcement machine learning algorithms is a method of learning that interacts with its
               environment by generating actions and discovers errors or rewards. The most relevant features
               of reinforcement learning are trial and error searching, and delayed reward.</td>

  <h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
  <p>It is the interactions between computers and human language where the computers are programmed to
    process natural languages. Machine Learning is a reliable technology for Natural Language Processing
     to obtain meaning from human languages. In NLP, the audio of a human talk is captured by the machine.
     Then the audio to text conversation occurs and then the text is processed where the data is converted
     into audio. Then the machine uses the audio to respond to humans. Applications of Natural Language
     Processing can be found in IVR (Interactive Voice Response) applications used in call centers, language
     translation applications like Google Translate and word processors such as Microsoft Word to check the
      accuracy of grammar in text. However, the nature of human languages makes the Natural Language Processing
       difficult because of the rules which are involved in the passing of information using natural language and
       they are not easy for the computers to understand. So NLP uses algorithms to recognize and abstract the rules
       of the natural languages where the unstructured data from the human languages can be converted to a format tha
       t is understood by the computer.</p>
       <h2>The importance of NPL</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Large volumes of textual data</li>
    <br>
      <p>The processing of natural language helps computers to communicate
        with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks.
        For instance, NLP allows computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it,
         measure feeling and determine which parts are important.</p>
         <li>Structuring a highly unstructured data source</li>
         <br>
         <p>Human language is astonishingly complex and varied. Infinitely,
            we express ourselves, both verbally and in writing. There are not
            only hundreds of languages and dialects but a unique set of grammar
            and syntax rules, terms and slang within each language. When we write,
            we often misspell or abbreviate words, or omit punctuation. When we speak,
            we have regional accents, and we mumble, stutter and borrow terms from other languages. </p>

  <h3>Ropotics</h3>
  <p>The purpose of Automation is to get the monotonous and repetitive tasks done by machines which also improve
     productivity and in receiving cost-effective and more efficient results. Many organizations use machine learning,
      neural networks, and graphs in automation. Such automation can prevent fraud issues while financial transactions
       online by using CAPTCHA technology. Robotic process automation is programmed to perform high volume repetitive
        tasks which can adapt to the change in different circumstances.</p>

  <h3>Machine Vision</h3>
  <p>Machines can capture visual information and then analyze it. Here cameras are used to capture the visual information, the analog to digital conversion is used to convert the image to digital data and digital signal processing is employed to process the data. Then the resulting data is fed to a computer. In machine vision, two vital aspects are sensitivity, which is the ability of the machine to perceive impulses that are weak and resolution, the range to which the machine can distinguish the objects. The usage of machine vision can be found in signature identification, pattern recognition, and medical image analysis, etc.</p>
