      <h1>Types of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    </div>
    <p>The main aim of Artificial Intelligence is to enable machines
	to perform a human-like function. Thus the primary way of 
	classification of AI is based on how well it is able to 
	replicate human-like actions. AI can, by and large, be
	classified based on two types, both of which are based 
	on its ability to replicate the human brain. One type 
	of classification which is “Based on Functionality” 
	classify AI on the basis of their likeness to the 
	human mind and their ability to think and feel like
	humans. The second way of classification is more 
	prominent in the tech industry which is” Based 
	on Capabilities” of AI vis-à-vis Human Intelligence.</p>

        to make better future decisions. These AI applications can be trained
		by a large volume of training data which they store in their
        memory in the form of a reference model</td>

 They store data like GPS location and speed of nearby cars</td>

	and are usually confined to research labs. These kinds of AI once
       developed will have a very deep understating of human minds 
	   ranging from their needs, likes, emotions, thought process, etc.</td>

  <td>This is the final stage of AL. These kinds of AI can not only understand and evoke human emotions but can also have emotions of its own.
    The AI can get into Self-Preservation mode it might consider humanity as a potential threat and may directly or indirectly pursue endeavor
    to end humanity.</td>

        cannot perform tasks for which it was not programmed before-hand, so they fail at performing unprecedented task. Based
        on the classification mentioned above, this system is the combination of all reactive and limited memory AI. AI algorithms
        which we use in today’s world for performing most complex Prediction Modelling falls under this category of AI.</td>
