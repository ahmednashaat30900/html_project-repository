      <h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence is an ability to design smart
	  machines or to develop self-learning software applications that
        <br>imitate the traits of the human mind like reasoning, 
		problem-solving, planning, optimal decision making, sensory
         <br>perceptions etc.  The capacity of artificial 
		 intelligent approaches to outperform human actions 
		 in terms of knowledge
         <br> discovery gained the attention of business and
		 research communities all over the world and this field of study
         <br>witnessed rapid progress in the past two decades. </p>
         <p>The field of AI was first coined in the year 1956 
		 by John McCarthy to distinguish it from cybernetics.
           <br> Four leaders in AI became the founders of AI 
		   and by the year 1959, computers were performing better checker
           <br>strategies than humans. Artificial Intelligence
		   is used in diverse fields such as Cybersecurity, military, government agencies,
           <br> Advertisement, Automations, etc.</p>
